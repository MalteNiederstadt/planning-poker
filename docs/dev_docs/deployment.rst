Deployment
==========

First of all: You should have set up your deployment for the Planning Poker app (see
`the docs there <http://rheinwerk.pages.intern.rheinwerk.de/planning-poker/dev_docs/deployment.html>`_ for help). You
can then follow the steps 1 through 4 from the :ref:`readme:Quickstart` guide and configure the settings to suit your
needs (see :ref:`user_docs/configuration:Configuration` for additional info). This is all the setup you have to do to
prepare the deployment.
